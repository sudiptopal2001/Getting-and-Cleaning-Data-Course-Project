CODEBOOK.

===========================================================================================
i. The "run_analysis.R" file contains the script with the 5 steps required in the course. 
ii.  The data set is downloaded and extracted in the folder "Dataset".

=======================================================================================================================

1. Step 1 merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
To do this, each of the following documents is assigned to a variable as follows:

features <- features.txt with col.names "Serial No.", "feature"
activities <- activity_labels.txt with col.names "code", "activity"

test.subject <- subject_test.txt with col.names "Subject"
test.label <- y_test.txt with col.names "Activity"
test.data <- X_test.txt with col.names = features$functions


train.subject <-subject_train.txt with col.names "subject"
train.label <- y_train.txt with col.names  "Activity"
train.data <- X_train.txt with col.names = features$functions


Then simply merge,

test.data, test.label and test.subject to test.data by cbind(), 
train.data, train.activity and train.label to train.data by cbind(),
and finally test.data and train.data by rbind().


2. Step 2 Extracts only the mean and standard deviation from each measurement.

To achieve this, only the columns containing the mean and std terms as well as the subject and code were selected.


3. Step 3 Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

These names are stored in the activities table. Using the gsub() function and for looping it over all the elemnts of data1$Activity, this can be done.


4. Step 4 Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

To do this, various expression substitutions were used to make the names readable. gsub() function and some regular expressions were used. 


Finally saved in tidydata.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To achieve this, only tidy data (final_data, in this case) was grouped by subject and activity and that result was passed to the summarize_all function so that could compute the mean of each group. That is saved in final_data table and in Tidy_Data.txt file
